# booth.io

booth.io is not just a random photo booth. It is an interactive video booth that fosters these small, but important relationships that really help make an experience special. Every morning, there will be a fresh new prompt available for CSE undergraduates to respond to. Users can record a 15 second video in response to the prompt. Our design helps UW CSE undergraduates connect on a common topic and get the members of our small community to feel like they are an important part of something bigger. 


## Getting Started

Clone the repo using bash or github desktop.

### Run booth.io

In order to run the demo, two folders are essential. The "signIn" and "OuterPrompt" folders.

First, the demo in the signIn folder includes all the working components. In order to run, go to the html file inside the folder and open with the browser of your choice.

The other folder "OuterPrompt" includes the demo version from the screen outside of the booth. If you've already seen our booth model, there is another screen outside of the booth but its only for browsing recorded messages, which means it doesn't contain the recording feature.

As you can see, each folder is labeled with its content. For each screen, we have a separate folder to store its components. Therefore, the user can go in and inspect each page individually.
